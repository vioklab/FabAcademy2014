It is very easy to install any virtual system following the instructions from the installer.<br>After installing Virtual Box machine. I choose Windows then to install it on virtual box I create a “new machine” and I follow the instructions.<br>Luciano, my Fab Lab instructor gave me a great tip to finish the Virtual Box configuration to allow my computer display my window in full screen:<ul><li>Running on Windows virtual machine ove Virtual Box, choose in the main navigation > Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD image…This command will mount a drive in your Windows OS with the other necessary drivers for Windows. Run the .exe file to allow the drivers installation.</li><li>Restart Virtual Box and then start your virtual windows machine that you already have created.</li></ul></p></section><section><h2>Installing Fab Modules</h2><p><a href="http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu/" target="_blank">http://kokompe.cba.mit.edu/</a></p><p>Running at Mac OS 10.8.2, after install wxPython I tried to install these dependancies with the command brew install boost cmake libpng gif lib. I received some errors since I already had installed MacPorts. Later, after uninstall MacPorts, I try to install again boost, cmake, etc.. and I still receiving an error. Now is a permission conflict over the link between boost and Homebrew.</p><p>With some help of my brilliant friend and, ex Fab Academy Student, John Rees, I learned from him new commands <strong>(chmod)</strong> to allow user permissions over folders to tried again and start working the installation permissions.<br><br><strong>command:</strong> sudo chown username 'folder or file'.<br><strong>command:</strong> brew link boost<br><br>Now I have to compile the files when necessary but I don’t need is necessary at the moment: actually, I am not using Fab Modules because I am using the access points of the Fab Lab, BCN.</p></section><!-- XXXXXXXXXXXX --><section><h2>Epilog experiments</h2><h4>How to send to print</h4><p>First is necessary to set up the file over Rhino. Using Command "P" on keyboard you can open the print configuration settings panel. After the configuration if your want to cut a vector or raster file, speed, power, color managing you need to configure the size of the cutting area over Rhino. After all these configurations you can send your print to the Epilog machine and you need to set up the new cutting manually:<ul><li>First put your material inside the Epilog and secure all sides of the material with tape.</li><li>Then you need to set the X/Y origin pressing first the X/Y Off button and then setting manually the new origin and then press "Ajuste de Inico"</li><li>The you need to set up the focus of the machine pressing on "Enfocar"</li></ul><br>Much of these steps can be done via software but for recommendations and to understand well the process we do it manually.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w3/c3.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w3/c2.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w3/c1.jpg"></div></div></div><p>Below I will try to describe my process for each piece I experimented.

They open my mind to see the infinite amount of possibilities to create and transform different materials and use them as fabricate structure elements.<br><br>It is a fact that is really needed a good planning, design and a strategy before getting into the machines.<br><br><h4>Best Config with to cut cardboard 2.5 mm - Epilog laser cutter machine</h4><strong>Speed:</strong> 70<br><strong>Power:</strong>65<br></p></section><!-- XXXXXXXXXXXX --><section><h2>References</h2><ol><li>An Open Source parametric 3D CAD modeler<br><a href="http://www.freecadweb.org/" target="_blank">http://www.freecadweb.org/</a><br></li><li>OpenSCAD<br><a href="http://www.openscad.org/" target="_blank">http://www.openscad.org/</a><br></li></ol></section><section><h2>Classmates references</h2><ol><li>Megafon: <a href="http://faces2014.megafon.ru/index_eng.html" target="_blank">Olympics Games Video Mapping</a> [Mery Glez]</li></ol></section></div>
