Each one that will be connected as a grid of electrical network into the soil by a recipient formed by coil sewed in a special fabric to retain water. It will also have a series of input and output devices to allow the interaction with users when plants receives an input signal and, to be able to change the environment of the plant for specific studies .</p><p>Based on a <strong>network of monitored sensitive plants</strong> or cyborg plants, how ever the online reporters call this movement today, throw a "DIY" philosophy at my Fab Academy journey, I will pretend to create a bunch of hardware and a software to gather data from a grid of embedded sensors network.</p></section><section><div class="margins-separator"><strong><i>First Sketch Ideas:</i></strong> Drawing of possible design of <strong>"Plant sense".</strong></div><img src="images/w1/sketch-plantsFeelSense-1.jpg" alt="first sketch" class="img-thumbnail"></section><section><h3>Some inspirational references</h3><p>A list of references where I take some of my inspirations to make this experiment and for further research:</p><ol><li>Stefano Mancuso - The roots of plant intelligence<ul><li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/stefano_mancuso_the_roots_of_plant_intelligence.html" target="_blank">http://www.ted.com/talks/stefano_mancuso_the_roots_of_plant_intelligence.html</a></li><li><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/31/internet-plants" target="_blank">http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/31/internet-plants</a></li><li><a href="http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/stefano-mancuso/" target="_blank">http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/stefano-mancuso/</a></li></ul></li><li>Bio Design, William Myers<ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bio-Design-Nature-Science-Creativity/dp/0870708449" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Bio-Design-Nature-Science-Creativity/dp/0870708449</a></li></ul></li><li>Botanicus Interactus: Interactive Plant Technology<ul><li><a href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/botanicus-interacticus-interactive-plant-technology/" target="_blank">http://www.disneyresearch.com/project/botanicus-interacticus-interactive-plant-technology/</a></li></ul></li><li>Leased - Plants employed as sensing devices<ul><li><a href="http://pleased-fp7.eu/" target="_blank">http://pleased-fp7.eu/</a></li></ul></li><li>Fungus is the Internet of the plant world<ul><li><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672566/fungus-is-the-internet-of-the-plant-world" target="_blank">http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672566/fungus-is-the-internet-of-the-plant-world</a></li></ul></li></ol></section><section><h3>Possible materials, components</h3><p>Below you can find a list of possibles materials, components and boards that I pretend to use.
