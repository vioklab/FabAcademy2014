Later into the board panel first I distribute all the components as I think it will work fine. Then I skip and create ease connections using "autorouter". It was bad idea! To many air connections and to much complicated routes. I had to look back to Hello board and try to follow the same order of the components and then add my custom components.</p><p>To create the "traces.png" file is necessary to hidde all layers except for top layer into Eagle. Then go to <code>file> export> image</code> and the you need to choose <code>500 dpi</code> resolution and check the button <code>Monochrome</code>.</p><p>After created my png traces file I open it into Photoshop and I edited cutting the extra black parts on the borders and then I add change the canvas size expanding <code>20px for each side of the area.</code>. I get the same file but 40px wider and higher.</p><p>Duplicating the same file and select the white border. Paint it black and then "select inverse" to paint the other area white.<br><br><br></p><p>When files are ready we go to the electronics production process.</p><!-- Gallery --><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w6/schematic.png"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w6/board.png"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w6/traces.png"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w6/hello-naked.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w6/hello-top.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w6/hello-perspective.jpg"></div></div></div></section><section><h2>What Iâ€™ve learned</h2><p>The design process in eagle is quite difficult at the beginning but with some practice it turns quite easy. Some suggestion when you are <code>designing your board</code> is to put your components close to the corresponding connections. Then you can make a <code>Ratsnest</code>. This will avoid you to have some unexpected behaviors on your board and also avoid burn it.</p></section><section><h2>Download Files</h2><p>You can download Eagle, board, traces and interior files here:<br><a href="https://github.com/vioklab/FabAcademy2014/tree/master/boards/hello44Leo-res4" target="_blank">https://github.com/vioklab/FabAcademy2014/tree/master/boards/hello44Leo-res4</a></p></section></div>
