As the composite needs to be a solid, instead using ribs (as you can see in the photo, I use a mesh object and then I transform into a solid making some little aesthetic changes. After the design process it is necessary to export the object as <code>.STL</code> as <code>binary natural format.</code></p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-6 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w2/ribs-1-2.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/view1.png"></div></div></div></section><section><h2>Milling the mold</h2><h4>Materials</h4><p>The Fab Lab have in the inventory the <code>Foam rigid expanded polyurethan</code></p><h4>Shopbot</h4><p>When STL file is ready we go to the <a href="http://www.shopbottools.com/mproducts/partworks_features.html">Shopbot PartWorks3D and we open the file.</a>.<br>The process is very easy as the User Interface of the sofware is very intuitive and let the user follow the 7 steps to set up the milling process.<br>First is necessary to define the size and set the orientation of the mold. The next is to set the Roughing toolpath that correspond to the tool dimensions and how will be the strategy of milling defining the x and y direction.<br>One of the nice futures of the software is that you can simulate the milling and how the machine will remove the material to have the last result.</p><p>As the same procedure as we follow before use each machine is to check if it is completely clean and the we continue preparing the material. We use a doble side addesive tape to fix the material in the the sacrifice board on the CNC machine. Then is necessary to set up the x,y (0,0) and the z-axis home coordinates values. For z-axis we have to use the metal shit located on the top of the drill motor: put the metal shit on the fixed foam and then connect the pin to the top of the drilling circut.Using the sofware autodetect the <code>z</code>.<br>For x,y coordinates you need to check visually the point were is the best place to start the milling: use the panel control of the software to move the machine in the corresponding axes. Take care to not press the z button.</p><p>When the settings were correctly set press the <code>green button</code> over the Shopbot hardware. Then press <code>return</code> to continue when the software ask to you.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/soft-1.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/soft-2.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/foam2.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/foam1.jpg"></div></div></div></section><section><h2>Composite Material Process</h2><p>I want to be shure that no will exit any Epoxic Resin shed into the vacuum machine so I added some extra layers for the composite.</p><ol><li>Breather at the bottom(cotton textile)</li><li>Plastic laminate without holes</li><li>High Desity Foam</li><li>Plastic laminate without holes</li><li>Epoxic Resin and Textile (Yute) - layer 1</li><li>Epoxic Resin and Textile (Yute) - layer 2</li><li>Plastic laminate wit holes</li><li>Plastic laminate without holes</li><li>Breather at the Top (cotton textile)</li></ol><p>For the <code>Epoxic Resin mixing ratio</code> 2 parts epoxy, 1 part hardener</p><p>When the Epoxic Resin mix be ready <code>soak the textile (yute)with the Resin</code> until it completely wet. Continuing you will need to <code>drain the textile</code> as much as possible to remove all the excess of resin. It is recommendable to use a large recipient to make all these work.</p><p>After make the composite layer by layer we use the new ..... <code>Vacuum Machine</code>code> that arrives the last weeks to compress the material for <code>6 hours</code> until the final composite material is fixed.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p1.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p2.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p4.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p5.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p6.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p7.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p8.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p9.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/p11.jpg"></div></div></div></section><!-- CONCLUSIONS --><section><h2>What I've learned</h2><p>It was a very intersting and happy assigment for me. I really enjoy leave for a couple of hours the computer and do manual work. The process was very easy to me since when I continue working with the machines and other material working processes I feel more confortable with the results. I've been also well adviced by Luciano.</p><p>A good advice is to work in a ventilated spaced, since the Epoxic Resin have a strong smell. But no too much! I worked in a open area and the wind makes some troubles specially with the plastic material.</p></section><!-- DOWNLOAD FILES --><section><h2>Download Files</h2><p>STL File: <a href="https://github.com/vioklab/FabAcademy2014/tree/master/composite" target="_blank">https://github.com/vioklab/FabAcademy2014/tree/master/composite</a></p></section></div>
