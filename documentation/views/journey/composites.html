As the composite needs to be a solid, instead using ribs (as you can see in the photo, I use a mesh object and then I transform into a solid making some little aesthetic changes. After the design process it is necessary to export the object as <code>.STL</code> as <code>binary format.</code></p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w2/ribs-1-2.jpg"></div></div><!-- <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb">

The next is to set the Roughing toolpath that correspond to the tool dimensions and how will be the strategy of milling defining the x and y direction.<br>One of the nice futures of the software is that you can simulate the milling and how the machine will remove the material to have the last result.</p><p>As the same procedure as we follow before use each machine is to check if it is completely clean and the we continue preparing the material. We use a doble side addesive tape to fix the material in the the sacrifice board on the CNC machine. Then is necessary to set up the x,y (0,0) and the z-axis home coordinates values. For z-axis we have to use the metal shit located on the top of the drill motor: put the metal shit on the fixed foam and then connect the pin to the top of the drilling circut.Using the sofware autodetect the <code>z</code>.<br>For x,y coordinates you need to check visually the point were is the best place to start the milling: use the panel control of the software to move the machine in the corresponding axes. Take care to not press the z button.</p><p>When the settings were correctly set press the <code>green button</code> over the Shopbot hardware. Then press <code>return</code> to continue when the software ask to you.</p><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/soft-1.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/soft-2.jpg"></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/finish-1.jpg"></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-xs-12 thumb"><div class="thumbnail"><img class="img-responsive" src="images/w11/finish-2.jpg"></div></div></div></section></div>
