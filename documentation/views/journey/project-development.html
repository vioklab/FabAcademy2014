Also my capacitance input devices are done. I had to re-builded because in the first prototype I use 10 M resistor that cause to much noise and it is very unstable. I choose to change the resistor to a 1M to make it less sensible. I am planning to use the plant pot frame as a prototype since I had to improve the joinery system.</p><p>Some tasks are stil remaining:<ol><li>Put 5V-1A regulator to my Xduino Board.</li><li>Mill 2 Xduinos boards and solder the components.</li><li>Check design and change conector on the Control Board to allow it connections with LCD, lights and the moisture soil sensor.</li><li>Design the speakers, lasser cutted and assembled.</li><li>Mill speakers electronics and solder the components.</li><li>Program the boards and connect the nodes.</li><li>Make connector cables.</li><li>Start enjoy making music,stimuli my plants and a long period of observation.</li></ol></p></section><section><h4>what questions need to be resolved?</h4><ol><li>I am still having the same problem of how to resolve the joinery system. For a simple solution to increase the resitance force of the structure in the corners, where is more unstable, I will use rubber band to fix and still maintain the press-kit as concept design.</li><li>How I will power supply all the project? For now I gather some 5V power generator to use with 2 boards, but I'm still searching for another one for the 3th boarth.</li></ol></section><section><h4></h4></section></div>
